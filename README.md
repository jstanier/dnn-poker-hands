# dnn-poker-hands
Using deep learning to predict the quality of poker hands.

This was created mostly so I could give myself a go at learning the high-level [TensorFlow APIs](https://www.tensorflow.org/), namely Estimators and Datsets. 

## Installing dependencies

This assumes you have virtualenv with support for Python 3 installed.

```
./setup.sh
```

## Training the model

You can run it using default parameters like so:

```
python estimator.py 

```
